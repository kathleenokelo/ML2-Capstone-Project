### Project Overview
Responsible AI is top of mind for business leaders, along with an urgent need to understand the decision process behind these algorithms. With great potential comes great risk. Not being able to understand an AI system can lead to a “black box” effect, which limits an organisation’s ability to explain and defend business-critical decisions.

In this project, a large bank has asked us to evaluate the marketing algorithms they use for retail banking. Their sophisticated phone marketing algorithm predicts whether a certain person will subscribe to a term deposit or not. Based on that assessment, the bank then optimises its phone calling strategy.

With this algorithm, the bank has been successful in predicting which clients are more likely to subscribe to their term deposits. Our task at hand is to explain to our clients how certain models and algorithms can lead to decision-making processes and to help explain both overall decision-making and also individual choices and predictions, tailored to the perspectives of different stakeholders.

### Business Understanding
Analyzing a bank's customer data to identify key segments that are most likely to convert to the bank's term deposit. By understanding which factors influence a customer's decision to subscribe to the term deposit, it is easier to develop targeted strategies to optimize marketing efforts, and ultimately increase revenue for the bank.
