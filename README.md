# ML2-Capstone-Project

With advanced business analytics, we can predict every interaction with customers, every moving part in your supply chain and every financial transaction. And it all possible with the data you already own.

In this project, we get to see how we can transform organizations into data-driven organizations, and work with them to define AI strategies for optimised data analysis and customer interactions. As the power of data and AI is enormous, PWC acts with utmost care to use it responsibly, integrating risk mitigation while translating ethical concerns into algorithms and data sets from the start.
